# cpp-asteroids
Asteroids is a classic video game, first brought to life by Atari in the late 70s. Players control a single spaceship, trying to survive in a space littered with fast-moving asteroids and enemy flying saucers. The goal is to avoid getting hit by these objects while shooting them down to score points. As the game progresses, more asteroids and saucers appear, upping the challenge.

Key gameplay features:

- Spaceship Control: Players can rotate their spaceship and move it across the screen using the thruster.
- Shooting Mechanics: Players can fire projectiles to destroy incoming asteroids and saucers.
- Variety in Asteroids: Asteroids come in different sizes and move at various speeds.
- Simple Graphics: Spaceship, asteroids, and saucers can be represented using basic geometric shapes like triangles, rectangles, circles, and polygons.
- Asteroid Disintegration: When a larger asteroid is hit, it breaks down into smaller pieces.
- Game Over: The game ends when the spaceship collides with any other object.
- Scoring: Points are awarded for each object destroyed and the score is displayed on screen.
- Developers are encouraged to enhance the game with additional features and effects. The game uses the wxWidgets framework, making it possible to easily add images and sound effects. Developers can also modify the game logic, such as giving players multiple spaceships to use or allowing enemy saucers to fire back, making the game even more exciting.
